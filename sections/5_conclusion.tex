\radcbm turns routine radiology reports into large-scale concept supervision and aligns model reasoning with how radiologists read chest X-rays.
Automated concept extraction plus a hierarchical, gated CBM yields faithful, region-aware explanations without sacrificing classification accuracy.
Experiments on MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert show that the hierarchy improves concept fidelity over flat CBMs and matches black-box performance while exposing actionable concept interventions.
Future work includes extending the vocabulary to cross-modality studies, integrating uncertainty estimation for rare findings, and prospectively evaluating clinician trust when explanations are delivered at the point of care.
